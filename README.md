# Advent Of Code 2022

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). All solutions are written in Python 3.

A word of caution: There are most certainly better, more efficient solutions out there. Sometimes I try to implement semi-efficient algorithms, but most of the time I don't. If I get complaints that my code sucks, I will probably just ignore them. No hard feelings.

As per Eric Wastl's request, I will not include input files along with my solutions. If you want to run my code (for some reason), inputs can be obtained by going to the AoC website and downloading them to the appropriate directory. For example, the input for day 1 should go into the "day_1" directory. Run each script from the root of this project.
